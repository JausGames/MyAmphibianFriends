# MyAmphibianFriends
Game made as party game content

My Amphibian Friends in a game made in 2 days thought of as a party game content.
Here you're playing a frog who's trying not to get catch by a monkey. You can only rotate on yourself, jump and double jump.
To survive you can try to catch the healing particle in the 2 wheels.

4 players can play at the same time, using keyboard, Xbox One/360 gamepad, PS4 gamepad or Switch gamepad.

You can find on the repository an export of the game and the unity project.

All codes, models and animation are homemade
